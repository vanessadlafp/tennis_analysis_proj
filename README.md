# Men's Professional Tennis Tour (ATP) Analysis: Project Overview

Inquiry raised by Toni Nadal's (Rafael Nadal's uncle and former coach) [Ted Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/toni_nadal_el_valor_del_esfuerzo) where he gives his standpoint on the impact that technology might have on the circuit, causing players to lose intuituon in the court and thus creating a huge gap between young and more experienced players, probably explaining why it's taking so much to the new ones to replace the old ones nowadays.
 
* Cluster analysis of 2011 and 2019 top 100 ATP ranking players to determine characteristics that magnify the gap between top players and the rest, and how they've changed over time. 

* Identified 4 main clusters for the years 2011 and 2019. However, seniority and the dominance of the Big Three (Djkovic, Nadal and Federer) have seemed to create a more competitive game for the rest of the players, as they have had to increase their tournement participation and strengthen all aspects of their game to improve their chances of defeating the champions. 

* Scraped stats for performance of the top 100 players for the years 2011 and 2019 from the ATP tour website using Python and Beautiful Soup.

* Applied Principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, and hence an optimal feature selection for the K-Means algorithm.
